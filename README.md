# CSS-Grid-Lab

I decided to revisit a style I had used before for this lab, which required the use of CSS grids. As a result, I took a previous project that utilized Flexbox and converted all the styles to grids. Additionally, I included a media query at the end to ensure that the layout is responsive on mobile devices with a screen width of 770 pixels or lower.
To help with this transition, I used Google to find the correct syntax for various grid properties and to better understand how they function.
